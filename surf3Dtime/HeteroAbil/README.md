# Code for Chapter 8: "S-period-lived Agents with Endogenous Labor and Heterogeneous Abilities"

This folder contains the code to solve the model presented in Chapter 8, "S-period-lived Agents with Endogenous Labor and Heterogeneous Abilities" of the textbook, *Overlapping Generations Models for Policy Analysis: Theory and Computation*. The files needed to run the model are the following 8 Python scripts and modules:

* `execute.py`
* `SS.py`
* `TPI.py`
* `households.py`
* `firms.py`
* `aggregates.py`
* `ability.py`
* `elliputil.py`
* `utilities.py`

This code was writen using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) of Python 3.5.2. The folders `images` and `OUTPUT` will be created (overwritten) in the course of running your script. The `images` folder will contain the images created in the process of running your code, both steady-state and transition path equilibria. The `OUTPUT` folder will contain the Python objects as well as underlying parameters (pickle .pkl files) from the steady-state and transition path equilibria.
